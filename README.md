# 🔺 Triangle Test

### 📖 About

This is an exercise I completed for my Software Engineer III class. It involves creating a program to determine the type of triangle (Equilateral, Isosceles, or Scalene) based on its coordinates in the Cartesian plane. Additionally, the task includes writing tests to check for bugs, handle invalid inputs, and ensure the program works as expected.

The file "triangulo.py" is the initial code I wrote, where the user inputs the coordinates, and it returns the type of triangle. If the triangle exists, it will also display it using the matplotlib.pyplot module.

The files "triangulo_final.py" and "teste_triangulo.py" contain the code for determining the triangle type and the unit tests, respectively.
